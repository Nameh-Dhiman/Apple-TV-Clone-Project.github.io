Home Page
Languages used
The website structure was made using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which allows helped us to create the structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. It is the core of making a web page.
The website looks amazing because of the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. We used CSS extensively in this website to make it look more pleasing to the eyes.
The website gets all of its data by using JS (JavaScript). We use JS to make the website dynamic and for DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.
Let us discuss some of the coolest features of the website.
Signup Page
Sign Up Page
This page itself defines the beauty of CSS that has been used. Once you click on the sign-in button on the top right corner, you will get this popup and the area behind this popup will automatically get darker to create more focus on the newly created Sign-in page. This page asks for your Apple ID ( if you already have an account ) and Create New Apple ID ( If you want to create a new account ) and Forget Apple ID or Password ( To reset your account credentials).

Home Page
The Home Page of the website consists of multiple options which allow user to catch up with the latest web series and most popular seasons.
Just by scrolling down the page, you can find a web series according to your mood. Few of the categories are:-
SCI-FI, Mysteries & Whodunits, Drama, Comedy, Inspiration, etc…
Once you click on any of the web series, you will land at a page that is dedicated to that web series, we call that as an internal page.
Internal Page

An Inner page for a web series must be that page that allows a user to look deep into the story and action in the web series. If the user gets some interest just by looking at the overview of the story then only he will watch the entire season. By keeping this thought in mind, we tried making this page much more informative and eye-catching.
Inside the inner page, the user will get to watch the trailer of the web series running on the top of the page, then just below that user will get the option to select between multiple seasons available for that web series. After that, inside every season the user will get to select between all the episodes available for that season ( Note that each episode consists of the details regarding the episode, time taken by that episode, and release date for that particular episode ). Below that, you can find related websites and after that, you will see the cast and crew of that web series.

And from that related content, you can easily switch to any other web series related to the similar topic and continue enjoying your evening…
And that’s all from me and my team, Hope you guys liked our work.
